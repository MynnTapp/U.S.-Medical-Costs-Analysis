# 📊 US Medical Insurance Data Analysis


## 📁 Project Overview

This project explores a U.S. medical insurance dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The dataset includes key information such as a person's age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.

The goal of this analysis is to uncover trends and relationships between these variables — such as how smoking status, gender, or region affect insurance costs or health factors like BMI.

## 🎯 Objectives

### The following questions are investigated:

    Do people in the Southwest smoke more than people in the Northwest?

    What is the average age of someone who has at least one child?

    What is the average insurance cost for smokers in the Northwest?

    What is the average BMI for people who smoke?

    What is the average BMI for people who do not smoke?

    What is the average insurance cost for females?

    What is the average insurance cost for males?

    Is there a significant difference in insurance cost between smokers and non-smokers?

    Which region has the highest number of smokers?

    Are there more male smokers than female smokers?

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

This project uses the following tools:

    Python 3

    Jupyter Notebook


## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is publicly available and contains the following columns:

    age: Age of the individual

    sex: Gender

    bmi: Body Mass Index

    children: Number of children/dependents

    smoker: Smoking status (yes/no)

    region: U.S. region (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)

    charges: Medical insurance cost

Note: The dataset is included in the project as insurance.csv.

## 📝 How to Run

    Clone this repository or download the .ipynb file.

    Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.

    Run jupyter notebook in your terminal to launch the notebook.

    Open the notebook file and run the cells one by one.

## 📌 Future Work

Possible extensions of this project could include:

    Predictive modeling using linear regression to estimate insurance charges

    Hypothesis testing to statistically verify patterns (e.g., t-tests)

    Deeper multivariate analysis or interaction effects

    Data storytelling dashboards with tools like Plotly or Tableau
